## Inverse Value Canvas

### Overview
The Inverse Value Canvas is a conceptual framework that transforms "missing features" or "omitted elements" from mere deficiencies into **value for those who have suffered losses due to their presence**. It converts absence into a "strategic asset" and is used to discover co-creation opportunities with different industries and markets.

### Structure: 4-Step Frame

| Step | Perspective | Guiding Questions |
|----------|------|----------|
| 1. Missing (Identifying the Absence) | What is missing? | What is that function/element? Why has it been considered "necessary"? |
| 2. Harmed (Understanding the Impact) | Who was disadvantaged? | Which industries/people have been disadvantaged by the presence of this element? |
| 3. Inverted Ally (Reverse Partners) | Who welcomes the absence? | Which positions/industries/value systems positively receive this absence? |
| 4. Strategic Fit (Strategic Elevation) | How can it be leveraged? | How can proposals/partnerships/messages be built that feature this absence as a strength? |

### Application Example: Community App Without E-Commerce Features

| Step | Content |
|----------|------|
| Missing | No e-commerce functionality (product sales/payments not possible) |
| Harmed | Physical stores and mall operators who experienced reduced sales due to e-commerce growth |
| Inverted Ally | Commercial facilities and regional revitalization groups seeking customer traffic and engagement |
| Strategic Fit | Position as a "store visit app" or "circulation experience trigger." Propose implementation to regional malls and tourist facilities. |

### Trigger Collection: Inspiration Map from Common "Absences"

| Missing Element | Those Harmed | Perspective Shift | New Proposal Target |
|------------------|---------|--------------|------------------|
| E-commerce functionality | Shopping districts/malls | Offline focus | Regional circulation app |
| Immediate reactions on social media | Educational/medical settings | Focus on deep dialogue | Continuous group dialogue app |
| Automatic translation | Interpreters/tour guides | Focus on human interaction | Experiential guide/dialect tourism |
| Cashless payments | Elderly population | Respect for cash culture | Friendly cash-accommodating store support app |
